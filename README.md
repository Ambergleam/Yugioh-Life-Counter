Yugioh-Life-Counter
===================

A simple Yu-Gi-Oh! life counter for Android.

Need help with keeping track of Life Points in a Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game duel? Perfect.

A Life Point calculator makes sure you never have to use an actual calculator, pen and paper, or simply guessing and estimating again.

The focus is on usability, reliability, and speed. This app is fast, simple, and very low on power consumption, which is perfect for a flurry of matches during a Regional or just a simple Saturday local.

No added fluff or unnecessary 'features' - only what a true duelist needs for each match.

Best of all - no advertisements and no cost. Free and ad-free? Yes, please.

If you have suggestions, please post them. Maybe I forgot an unusual mechanic or two,  so there is plenty of room to expand the random number generation beyond the rare Snipe Hunter's die roll or more rare Time Wizard's coin toss.

Never again lose track of an opponent's life points.
